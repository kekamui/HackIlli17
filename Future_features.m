Future features that we would like to implement include specialized text-based messages for different types of target images. For example, a desk could have a message/reminder about studying, and a window could give a message about the weather. In addition, we were thinking of enabling the app to show multiple messages at once, when more than one target image is on-screen. 
	Current bugs include not being able to display specialized messages for different types of target images, and not being able to run on Android. These should be fixed in the future.
